<p>From the second week of Phase 0 when we first launched our website it has been a roller-coaster.  Previously, I have not had any HTML or CSS skills so this was a completely new experience to me.  I have to say at times it has been frustrating trying to align certain things with CSS, but it also has been a ton of fun building something that is just mine.</p>  
<p>When you go to other websites, you immediately judge how well the site functions.  Looking back at my own experiences, the weird thing with this is that you very rarely tell yourself that the site you are visiting is organized and well put together, however when a site is poor, you immediately tell yourself that you hate this site.  Originally, my goal with my site was to make it clean, organized and not let others have that first overall impression of disliking my site.  However, once I finished my MVP (minimum value project), I just wanted to continue to add to it and incorporate good ideas from other sites into mine.  Therefore, throughout the weeks, I have enjoyed having an idea and have had the ability to put that on a page.  It has been fun receiving feedback on my site and continuing to add more and more abilities.</p>
