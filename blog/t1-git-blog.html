				<div id="post_1">What are the benefits of version control?

					<p>Version control is a very cool and can potentially make your life much easier.  This process will save you time because it is orderly and simple.  From the beginning of writing a program you can save your work.  However, version control is not like the common save tool, like Word where when you save your work you replace the current version.  The beautiful part of version control is that when you ‘save’ your work the previous version is not replaced; the new version is added just above the previous version.  This then allows you to track changes by just looking back at an earlier version of the information.  For example, suppose a once-functioning program no longer worked after changes you made.  Therefore by comparing the changes between the current version and the previous known-good version it will reduce the time and effort required to locate and fix the errors.  This is ideal if you want to experiment with a code and or happen to make a mistake as you can just go back to a previous working version.  Version control also makes working with teams less chaotic; as it allows for multiple people to work on the same code in different location without contradicting each others work.</p> 

					<p>How does git help you keep track of changes?<p>

					<p>Git is a program on your local computer where you can save or update your current files with ease.  Git works on your computers command prompt and helps you keep track of changes by keeping every single commit or save you make.  Git also uses version control and shows you the contents of your files exactly as you originally saved them.  The good thing with Git is that it allows you to add to the previous version but also add a personal message with your upload.  The one new thing that git adds is this “commit” method.  Each and every save or upload you “commit” you must write a message either describing the change you have made or something else useful to look back on.  This makes it super simple to look back to understand your previous changes.  This message you write is very valuable as these messages allow you to easily look back and see exactly what you had done previous without reviewing the entire document.</p>  

					<p>Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>

					<p>GitHub is a great place to store code and a great publishing service.  It is simple to use with git, has a version control and it is now the largest online storage space for collaboration.  GitHub is a solid internet place to store code because it lives remotely on the internet.  Therefore it doesn’t matter where you are or that you are on your own personal computer; you can pull up, interact with your code and push (send) it back to GitHub.  But GitHub is not just a place to store code it is also a social-media website.  GitHub allows you to easily collaborate with each other, work on someone else’s code or work together on a project.  GitHub thus makes it easy to use and allows you and others to collaborate, pull, and push your code.</p>
