		<tr id="post_1"><p>Have you ever thought about how you learn?  No, stop, I am actually asking you, have you ever actually sat down and thought about what’s the best learning environment for yourself.   Well don’t feel bad, for me I definitely have not.  If you say something like “who has the time,” “it’s not relevant to my success,” and “I just want to get things done.”  Then you are very similar to me, as I have always thought that learning how I learn seemed very strange to me and think about everything else I could be getting done with this ‘wasted time.’  Nevertheless, when I actually did sit down and learned how I learn, I found it extremely beneficial to myself.  Think about it, subconsciously you know what circumstances account to your best learning abilities, but have you ever heard the word or seen it on paper.  No, but when you do it will change everything. 
 If you want to find out for yourself take this quiz: <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style.</a></p> 
<p>After I took Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, I discovered that my learning style is “Concrete Sequential.”  I know those words don’t seem like much like now, but once I did a little research on what traits a concrete sequential learner has, I realized that it is exactly me.<p> 
<p>Concrete sequential learners work best when they…</p>
<div>1.	have an orderly quiet environment.</div>
"I don't have the radio blasting away while I study." 
<div>2.	know the accepted way of doing things.</div>
"I'm not volunteering to be the first at anything." 
<div>3.	have exact directions and examples.</div>
"Let's do it right the first time." 
<div>4.	can be consistent and efficient.</div>
"Let's get on with it." 
<div>5.	face limited change in predictable situations.</div>
"I need to know what is happening to me!" 
<div>6.	are given approval for specific work done.</div>
"I want to know I'm on the right track." 
<div>7.	can apply ideas in a practical hands-on way.</div>
"If it's not useful, why do it?" 
<div>8.	can answer, "How does it work?" </div>
<div>9.	are able to trust that others will follow through.</div>
"I need to count on you to do what you said." 
<div>10.	have guided practice with an organized person.</div>
"Let me see a good way to work it out."</p>
<p>Like WOW, all of these describe my perfect learning environment, it’s crazy.  Looking back on these past few weeks in DBC’s Phase-0, I have had my problems, who hasn’t.  Other than the technical issues I encountered, there also are a few problems associated to my learning.  These problems include: I always want to “have exact directions,” “face limited change,” and “can apply in a practical hand-on way.”  These three have not only affected me in Phase-0, but also have plagued me for some time now.  I like the ways I learn, am very stubborn at changing, and have always liked exact, predictable, and practical methods.  The single biggest struggle for me has been not knowing what lies ahead.  As I said, I am a very predictable and schedules person and if I do not know what lies ahead, I cannot plan my hours, and feel scattered.  Fortunately, I have figured out how the next seven weeks will function, I am much more comfortable moving forward.</p>  
<p>The problem with my mindset is that I have issues dealing with any other situation.  I know I have this problem and I need to work on it.  If I cannot find a way to adapt to other environments, I know I will have issues succeeding in my future.  Since the first step is determining my style, next I need to act.  By considering a fixed vs. Growth mindset approach, I need to establish a growth mindset and have to broaden the ways I learn and think.  I cannot be stuck in this same mindset my entire life and need to change my learning environment.  Humans need to have flexibility and change in their lives or we will go nowhere.  My plan is to once a week go out of my comfort zone and learn in a place I am not accustomed to.  I might go to a coffee shop, or go outside, whatever really spark my mind and I am just going to roll with and not think about it.  I believe this is an actionable, reasonable plan.</p>  
<p>Although it can be tough to actually act upon it, it is good to know your personal learning capacity, the better-rounded you can become, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.  Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains.  So after you take the quiz, think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think.</p>
