					<p>How many times in your life have you typed in a password on a web app?  Hundreds? Thousands?  Crazy right?  Think of how many different sites you have to put a password in for?  All of the social media sites, bank accounts, health care, email sites, personal sites, and heck even your computer and phone need a password anymore.  Now think of how many different password phrases you actually have?  Probably not many, right?  If you are like me, I have my few variations, but I stick to a simple blueprint; how am I supposed to remember all of the different password, without creating a book to store all of my passwords?</p>  
					<p>Can you image if someone got your sacred “Password?”  It is crazy to think of it, that a few presses on a keyboard can gain anyone access to your Facebook account or even your bank account.  Therefore, without a doubt one of the main problems in the tech world is the simple “password.”  How do you make it secure anymore?  Unless you have installed an eye-scanner, blood sampler, or a finger print, the answer nowadays is that you really can’t.  Some sites make you add exclamation points, ampersands or like five numbers but then you can’t remember them anymore.  Even if you can think of and remember a so-called “unbreakable” password, someone can click on forgot password, and all the site asks you are simple questions; like what street were you born on?  Or what was your first dog’s name?  And the problem with that is that if you are an important figure, anyone with a computer can find that information with a couple clicks of a mouse.  Do you remember a couple months ago when the leaked photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice and Kate Upton came out?  Did they do anything wrong?  No they didn’t.  They had passwords and those passwords got hacked.   It is scary that anyone can possibly access your personal information.</p>  
					<p>The problem is that we don’t know what actions to take about this problem. We can try and make passwords stronger and harder to hack, but hackers will always find a way around this and this is not a long term solution to this pressing problem.  In my opinion, one of the only things to prevent this is to use a personal scanner to recognize oneself.  It is the only logical explanation to security issues.</p> 
					<p>Story time!  Last night when I got my ass off the couch and put a blue ray disc into my Xbox One, sat down and then 30 seconds later on the screen it says “Hello Matt.”  It hit me, why aren’t we using this technology.  If my Xbox can recognize me to sign me into my account, why can’t we use this with more important things?  I believe facial recognition can become great security protection.  If you think of it, you wouldn’t have to buy or do much differently because every computer and phone nowadays already has a front facing camera on it.  Therefore instead of typing in a password you can just use your camera to identify yourself.  It seems more secure and actually easier for the user.  This seems like a manageable solution to the pressing problem, right?  So I’m going to go patent my idea, so I’ll leave you there.</p>
