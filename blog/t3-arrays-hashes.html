<p>Array vs. Hash, Hash vs. Array.  Which one is better? How are they similar? How are they different? Well, I will tell you the short version of everything you will need to know to uses either one of these efficiently.  I could give you a technical definition but the simple version is that they both store data.  That&#39;s it, they keep your information in a nice easily accessible place.  But why are there two? Why do we need both?</p>
<p>I know these two might be a little confusing but with real example you will see that they are straight forward.  The simple way of looking at the difference between an array and a hash is to actually show you what they look like and how they work.</p>  
<div>An array: is an ordered list of things.</div>  
<div>An array looks like this: my_array = [a, b, c, d].</div> 
<p>An array stores anything you put in it, it is a list of anything you would like. For example is you want to store your favorite sport teams; you can have an array like:</p>
<div>favorite_teams = [Giants, 49ers, Kings]</div> 
<p>On the contrary, a hash is just a fancier version of an array.  A hash: is a collection of key/value pairs.  A hash looks like this:</p> 
<div>my_hash = {a => &quot;w&quot;, b => &quot;x&quot;, c=> &quot;y&quot;, d => &quot;z&quot;}</div>
<p>In the same example as above, if you would like to add the sport in which your favorite team plays you can have a hash like:</p>
<div>favorite_teams = {baseball => &quot;Giants&quot;, football => &quot;49ers&quot;, basketball => &quot;Kings&quot;}</div>
<p>Where you can put any values into the variables.  Easy enough, a hash points an object to another object.  A key and a value.  Think of it putting an answer the question.  The key as the question and the value as the answer.  In a real life example, you know when you buy something online and you have to type in all of your info, like: name, address, zip, state and so on. A ruby website might use a hash to store all of this data.  This is a little easier way of reading a hash.</p>  
<div>my_info = {</div>
<div>name => &quot;Megan Fox&quot;,</div>
<div>city => &quot;Oak Ridge&quot;,</div> 
<div>state => &quot;Tennessee&quot;,</div> 
<div>zip => &quot;37830&quot;,</div>
<div>}</div>
<p>Well that&#39;s it. Arrays and Hashes.  Hashes and Arrays.  I hope now you can successfully use each one of these.  Once you get these down, it is much easier to store your data.</p>
