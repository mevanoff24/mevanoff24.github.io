		<tr id="post_1">What's your take on the DBC experience? 

		<p>DBC is going to be an exciting, challenging, and fast-paced environment.  I know before even really diving into the material that I am going to learn so much more in nineteen weeks, than an entire year in college.  My take on the DBC experience is that DBC is more of an experience than just a school and a “package.”  The Kitchen vs. Restaurant was a personal mind opener and DBC is unlike the typical school.  It isn’t a competition between students to ‘set the curve’ and get the best grade in the class.  Because we are not supposed to be perfect, we are supposed to “make a mess”, be creative and blow minds.  Students are not just seen as individuals going through each day by yourself, but you will work with one another, grow together, fail together, and every cohort is in it together.</p> 

		<p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p> 

		<p>Honestly, I can’t wait to start this journey, I am going all in on this experience and I believe you have to.  The DBC culture might be different for some, but I believe than DBC has a solid foundation behind all of their madness, and I look forward to becoming one of their guinea pigs.  They are big into teams, pairs, and groups and I have played sports my entire life and have grown to love the teamwork.  I have always loved being part of teams and believe that DBC has a unique team culture.  DBC is much more of a team challenge than a personal one. </p>    

		<p>Does it make you nervous?</p>  

		<p>I don’t know how DBC doesn’t make someone nervous.  80 hour weeks.  Am I going to fit in?  New languages.  New people.  New environment.  If you are not nervous for something like this, I would say you’re lying.  I am going to engulf myself into something that I basically knew nothing about a few weeks ago.  I am scared and nervous, however with this nervousness come excitement.  I am excited to participate in this kind of learning environment.  Excited for the unknown.  Excited to see how far I can go.  I have always believed that you should be nervous for something that is important to you, and there is no difference here.</p>
