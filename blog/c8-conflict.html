<p>The last time I had an emotional conflict with someone was a couple years ago during college.  I was having an issue with one of my teammate that also happened to be one of my roommates.  It really wasn’t one certain action that he did, but a combination of all his actions that seemed to build up and really get on my nerve as well as it did a few other of my teammates.  I guess the big thing that all of this compiled up into was that he thought he was better than everyone else.  He thought that he had the right to do what he wanted and he could miss practice or ditch out on work that everyone else had to do.  All of this drove me crazy and I started resenting everything he did.</p>  
<p>The issue with this conflict was that it was a very tender subject.  There was a fine line in doing too much and blowing this issue out of hand because he was still my teammate, roommate, and I am around him for multiple hours each day.  I also didn’t want to make this issue affect our team chemistry.  I didn’t want to disrupt the family vibe that we had created within our community.</p>
<p>I told myself if the opportunity arose, I would act upon the situation.  However, deep down I didn’t search too much to find that opportunity, so my big answer to this problem was to do nothing.  Yeah, I know, not my greatest moment.  For this situation, I had to contemplate the risk and reward.  The risk was much worse than the reward, so I decided to try and let it go as there were only a couple more months left in the school year.</p>  
<p>So I masked my issues and went on with my life.  This is kind of how I have always dealt with problems is the past and it usually somewhat defuses itself.  Nothing big came out of this and I am thankful for that, but I did tend to avoid my teammate throughout the day and grew apart.</p>   
<p>Looking back upon it now, this seems as a petty issue and I should have dealt with it right away before it really built up.  And also families are supposed to get things out in the open and deal with them head on and I think our team dynamic would have grown.  In the end, I am not proud how I dealt with the situation, but I was too fearful of the consequences of the contrary, but in the end I did nothing and lost a friend.</p>
