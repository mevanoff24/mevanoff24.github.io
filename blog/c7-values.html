<p>The value that is the most important to me is Confidence.  I have always believed that life is 30% of what you do and 70% on how you react to it and having confidence will not only be useful for that first 30%, but prepares you for that other 70%.  I believe that everything in life starts with confidence and if you don’t have confidence in yourself, you will not enjoy or succeed at anything in life.  Confidence is not a trait, it is a mindset.   I know it is rash, but if you have self-confidence, you have the ability to accomplish anything you set your mind to.</p>  
<p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</p>
<p>The last topic someone ask my advice on is how I have the ability to stay cool and collected under pressure.  I have always been good at keeping calm even in the most stressful times; maybe it is because I have pitched in front of thousands of yelling fans all throughout my college baseball career and have never let anyone get under my skin.  I have always had that sort of calmness about me.  My solution to someone asking me how I do this, is ask WHY?  What’s the point of getting all worked up about something that you cannot change and is out of your control.  It is a personal feeling and you control your feelings, so why worry about what you can’t control and never let things beyond your control influence your life.</p>
<p>How do you feel when you think about your values?  Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</p> 
<p>When I think about my values, I feel proud.  I am proud of who I have become and how I feel about myself.  Obviously I have my doubts and have made my mistakes, but I know that nothing can stop me in becoming the person I want to become.  In regards to stereotype threat, I can’t and won’t let anyone else tell me how I should live my life.  I am ultimately in control of my own future and the only person who can influence me is myself.  When I am feeling down, I just tell myself to think back and remember everything I have accomplished up to this point and in every one of those situations the real reason I had truly felt satisfied is because I had to fight for what I wanted.</p>
