						What are the benefits of version control?
						Version control is a very cool and can potentially make your life much easier. This process will save you time because it is orderly and simple. From the beginning of writing a program you can save your work. However, version control is not like the common save tool, like Word where when you save your work you replace the current version...

						What's your take on the DBC experience?
						DBC is going to be an exciting, challenging, and fast-paced environment. I know before even really diving into the material that I am going to learn so much more in nineteen weeks, than an entire year in college. My take on the DBC experience is that DBC is more of an experience than just a school and a “package.” The Kitchen vs. Restaurant was a personal mind opener and DBC is unlike the typical school. It isn’t a competition between...

						What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
						Before we dive into the relative, absolute, and fixed positioning. We need to learn more about the background on the subject. First, we need to wrap our heads around the fact that every single element on a webpage is a block, meaning everything in a webpage is literally rectangles of pixels. And how these blocks of rectangles are positioned can be static, relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. Before you add any coding or styles to the...

						Have you ever thought about how you learn? No, stop, I am actually asking you, have you ever actually sat down and thought about what’s the best learning environment for yourself. Well don’t feel bad, for me I definitely have not. If you say something like “who has the time,” “it’s not relevant to my success,” and “I just want to get things done.” Then you are very similar to me, as I have always thought that learning how I learn seemed very strange to me and think about everything else I could be getting done with this ‘wasted time.’ Nevertheless, when I...

All of the social media sites, bank accounts, health care, email sites, personal sites, and heck even your computer and phone need a password anymore. Now think of how many different password phrases you actually have? Probably not many, right? If you are like me, I have my few variations, but I stick to a simple blueprint; how am I supposed to remember all of the different

						Pairing and working together is not something you think about when you think of computer programming. The image that pops into my mind is from the movie, The Social Network; a person isolating themselves, wearing big headphone, staring into a computer screen hours on end. It wasn’t until Dev Bootcamp that my notion of individual programming was shattered. Pair programming has become more important in today’s world and is important to recognize.

						When you think of a “class” you might think back to when you were 16, sitting in front of your boring World History teacher, trying not to fall asleep. However, I am going to break that nightmare and bring you to a better place; a happy Ruby place. Since, Ruby is an object-oriented language, Ruby’s classes are one of the things that make Ruby special and superior to other languages. Classes are vital to Ruby and a great way to store groups of methods and great to contain variables that can actually be used outside its original method. I always think that it

						What do you think of when you think of stereotypes? Quick, first thing that pops into your mind? Do you perceive stereotypes as positive or negative thing? Yeah, I think I can guess your answers, don’t feel bad, most of us think the same way. It is really tough to think of stereotypes are being portrayed as a positive notion. Most of us have a similar feeling as Claude M. Steele, with his researching minority under-achievement and developed a theory called “Stereotype Threat.” “Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative

Ok, you got me, maybe not that cool, but variables are extremely important to any program as can make your life a living hell if you don’t know how to use them. So it is best to learn them now.

					<div class="entry">
						The value that is the most important to me is Confidence. I have always believed that life is 30% of what you do and 70% on how you react to it and having confidence will not only be useful for that first 30%, but prepares you for that other 70%. I believe that everything in life starts with confidence and if you don’t have confidence in yourself, you will not enjoy or succeed at anything in life. Confidence is not a trait, it is a mindset. I know it is rash, but if you have self-confidence, you have the ability to accomplish anything you set your mind to.

						Well, I have to say that I love Ruby. Ruby seems to be such as easy language to understand and you have the ability to create programs that people without a computer background can actually understand. I have been working with Ruby and for the past month or so and I have now just launched myself into JavaScript and I have to say that other than the different syntaxes, these object oriented languages are very similar. I could go on and on about all of the different similar things that these two language share, but in this post, I am going to focus on Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions. So how are Ruby Classes and JavaScript functions different and

						The last time I had an emotional conflict with someone was a couple years ago during college. I was having an issue with one of my teammate that also happened to be one of my roommates. It really wasn’t one certain action that he did, but a combination of all his actions that seemed to build up and really get on my nerve as well as it did a few other of my teammates. I guess the big thing that all of this compiled up into was that he thought he was better than everyone else. He thought that he had the right to do what he wanted and he could miss practice or

						Regular expressions can be very useful in your programming career and having a good understanding of them will be essential. A regular expression is used to match a pattern against strings. Also called Regexps, they are created using the /.../ or the Regexp::new constructor. Regular expression are basically code using weird symbols to symbolize characters. Regular expressions are patterns which describe the contents of a string. They’re used for testing whether a string contains a given pattern, changing or extracting the portions that match.

						Looking back on my experience with the Phase 0, the two best learning resources were the power of google and the resourcefulness of asking questions on google hangout. However the issue with asking questions remotely is that it can be hard to receive the exact feedback as you wished. You cannot get mad at the person responding to the question, as they are only trying to help. Therefore, you have to look at the structure of the question you asked. Was the question easy to answer? How would you approach the question if it was asked to you?

						From the second week of Phase 0 when we first launched our website it has been a roller-coaster. Previously, I have not had any HTML or CSS skills so this was a completely new experience to me.
