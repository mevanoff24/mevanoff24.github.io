					<p>So I am going to explain to you a new method today.  Today’s method is “map.”  Map is an enumerable method in ruby that can be very powerful and very useful when used correctly.  It is familiar to the all popular “each” method, so if you are familiar with the .each method, you are in luck, but if not, don’t worry as I will make them both clear to you.</p> 
					<p>In Ruby Docs – Map – says: “invokes the given block once for each element,” but this is just like the each method as it also iterates the given block once for each method.  However, the difference and good thing about map is that it also “creates a new array containing the values returned by the block.”  This make the map method very useful when dealing with arrays and hashes.  Often at times you want to return another array when iterating through an array or a hash and map allows you do so.  It will allow you to run an operation on each of your array's objects and return them all in the exact same place, which is really convenient.  Just picture map as “re-mapping” your original object through some sort of transformation.</p>


					<p><p>Map also allows you to change a hash into an array. So if you have a hash of your brother’s ages, like this:</p>
					<p>brothers_age = {"Jim" => 6, “Walt" => 13, "Tyler" => 21}</p>
					<p>brothers_age.map will return this:</p>
					<p>=> [["Jim", 6], ["Walt", 13], ["Tyler", 21]]</p>
					<p>Seems very useful, right? All you do is iterate over every element in the block and is added into a new array. Here’s another example:</p>
					<p>Let’s say you want to multiply all values of the following hash by 2:</p>
					<p>hash.map {|k, v| v*2 }</p>   
					<p>=> [6, 2, 4]</p>
					<p>Then if you want to see if an element is odd.</p> 
					<p>.map(&:odd?)</p> 
					<p>=> [false, false, false]</p></p>

					<p>Although not a good example after you multiply them all by 2, but you get the point.  Each element is iterated through and each one returns false.  This can be great for debugging as it is very good for ruby as you don’t have to loop through each element, to check if they are even or odd.  So, hopefully you can now successful use map, and
					<div>Just remember:</div>
					<div>Use each when you need to loop through an array and don’t want an array.</div> <div>Use map when you need to loop through an array and return another array.</div></p>  
					<div>Yet again,</div>
