<p>Looking back on my experience with the Phase 0, the two best learning resources were the power of google and the resourcefulness of asking questions on google hangout.  However the issue with asking questions remotely is that it can be hard to receive the exact feedback as you wished.  You cannot get mad at the person responding to the question, as they are only trying to help.  Therefore, you have to look at the structure of the question you asked.  Was the question easy to answer?  How would you approach the question if it was asked to you?  Whatâ€™s the issue with your question?  These are 5 important things to ask yourself before clicking submit.</p>

<p><div>1.	Does my title summarizes the specific problem?</div> 
<div>2.	Do I introduce the problem before you post any code? And actually ask a question?</div>
<div>3.	Did I include all relevant tags?</div>
<div>4.	Do I allow others reproduce the problem?</div>
<div>5.	Proof-read!</div></p>

<p>I know, asking a simple question seems easy, but it can be extremely frustrating when you ask a question and do not receive anything close to what you were expecting.  So make sure you do your research beforehand on how to ask the correct question and make sure you utilize the internet and know everything you can beforehand.</p>
