					<p><strong>Pairing</strong></p> 
					<p>Pairing and working together is not something you think about when you think of computer programming.  The image that pops into my mind is from the movie, The Social Network; a person isolating themselves, wearing big headphone, staring into a computer screen hours on end.  It wasn’t until Dev Bootcamp that my notion of individual programming was shattered.  Pair programming has become more important in today’s world and is important to recognize.</p>  
					<p>Throughout my entire life, I have played sports; I played in high school, throughout college and I have grown accustomed to being a part of a team and sharing the same goal.  And when I came involved with programming, I wasn’t expecting the same type of environment to be utilized.  However, I am grateful to work with others.  When I pair to solve challenges, I feel as if I am not mentally stranded and I am a part of something greater than myself.  It is always a nice to work with someone else and have the support and knowledge that they are very similar to yourself.  It is nice to be able to have two brains tackle a particular challenge.</p>  
					<p>The most rewarding thing about pairing is the moment when you finally discover the answer that you both have been struggling with for some time.  You feel as if you are the hero and it is nice to feel that level of accomplishment with someone else.  The only thing that is frustrating to me at this moment and the thing that I do not enjoy about pairing, is nothing about the actual pairing, but trying to set up a remote pairing session with others.  I feel as if half the challenge is trying and waiting for someone else to be at the same level as you and find and coordinate your different schedules.  Other than that, I believe two minds are always greater than one and I enjoy working with like individuals to conquer a similar goal.</p>  
					<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
					<p>Feedback has always been a controversial conception.  Is it good?  Is it helpful?  Will people take it serous?  I believe the answer to all of these are yes.  Even if a person doesn’t want to take it seriously, what they read will always be engraved in the back of their mind.  And when it comes to feedback there are two different emotions a person has.  There is no middle ground when it comes to reviewing yourself and how to interact with other and how they perceive you; only happy and mad.  Some of you might try and shrug it off criticism and say, “oh, well”, but that is just a private thing you do to try and make yourself feel better.  Deep down you know if you are satisfied or angry.  And initially you might think you are mad at the individual that reviewed you, however you are ultimately mad at only yourself.</p>  
					<p>Therefore, even though if you don’t believe it all feedback is helpful to your wellbeing, it can be.  You need to have a growth mindset and use the feedback to learn and grow from your mistakes, not dwell on them.  I am really trying to put this notion into play and based on the feedback I have received, the main thing I am going to work on improving is my communication.  I have had almost all good feedback associated with myself which makes me pleased, except for one, and that one has really gotten to me and I will work on it so it never happens again.</p> 
					<p>On actually wring feedback, it is tough at times to rate others.  At first it was really tough.  What am I supposed to say?  How do I rate another person?  What if they get mad at me?  Am I supposed to use the “shit” sandwich technique or what?  However, once I actually did it and didn’t get any hate emails in return, I felt as it was much easier and now it is almost second nature.  I’m not talking about the kindness you say to one another as it is always easy to say good things to others but when it comes to constructive criticism, you don’t want to make them upset with you, but you are also trying to tell them what they should be working on to improve themselves. It can be tough to find that middle common ground.</p>  
					<p>Overall, I think that is it not the best practice to think of pairing and issuing feedback as key learning techniques as they can potentially hold you back, but I do believe that pairing and feedback are both good accessary efforts for learning.  They both can assist you on solidifying concepts and allow you to teach others and in turn help yourself.  However, the only way that these techniques will ever be useful to oneself is if they actually dive head first into them.</p>
