					<p>What do you think of when you think of stereotypes?  Quick, first thing that pops into your mind?  Do you perceive stereotypes as positive or negative thing?  Yeah, I think I can guess your answers, don’t feel bad, most of us think the same way.  It is really tough to think of stereotypes are being portrayed as a positive notion.  Most of us have a similar feeling as Claude M. Steele, with his researching minority under-achievement and developed a theory called “Stereotype Threat.”  “Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group”   (Steele and Aronson, 1995).  This concept began when they performed studies determining that black freshmen and sophomore students performed inferior on standardized test than white student when race was emphasized; else the two races performed equally.  So do you believe this study true?  Do stereotypes really make people underperform?  Even if you think this can’t be true, it is hard not to believe the evidence.</p>  
					<p>I think everyone at some point in their life has had a personal relationship with stereotype threats.  Even though most people think of racial stereotypes, however there are many other stereotypes in this world.  In my experiences, I have had a close relationship with a stereotype threat.</p>  
					<p>First of all, I went to California Berkeley on a baseball scholarship.  While my teammates and I were in one of our business classes, we were assigned to do a group project with random people throughout the class.  I was placed in a group and we had to split up the tasks to each group member.  So we went around, everyone collaborating on what task each member should do.  Then it came to me, and as everyone in my group knew that I played sports, and in a school like Berkeley, athletes don’t get a good wrap on being extremely intelligent.  So, in my group, I was assigned the easiest task, it wasn’t even an intellectual task, but more of a social task of interacting with others.  At first, I was frustrated that my group considered me a “dumb jock,” but I felt as it would do more harm than good trying to argue, so I just nodded to do this inferior task.  Then a couple days later, after the project was done, we had a test on the learning capacities of the project and I didn’t know some of the keys aspect because my group excluded me from the business side of the project, so I did not receive a good grade.</p>
					<p>I was pretty mad about this and my group used the false stereotype and I know after this incident, it will never happen again.  The only way to avoid a stereotype threat is to be aware of the situation.  My advice to anyone who might perform inferior, is to recognize these situations, and stand up for yourself.  There is nothing else you can do.  Use it as fuel, prove them wrong.  I have always been in favor of proving others wrong.  I have always hated when people tell me that I can’t do something, it makes me want to do that task even more.  I have never been a really emotional person and I learn from my mistakes and grow from everything I do.  If it doesn’t kill you it will make me stronger.</p>
					<p>Be smart,</p>
