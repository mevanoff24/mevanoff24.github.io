            <h1>Why is Pair Programming important?</h1>
            <p>Pair Programming is important because it allows each teammate helps 
            the other out, which is especially useful for novice programmers who 
            are still learning the ropes of coding.</p>

            <h1>Compare the Driver and the Navigator</h1>
            <p>The primary difference between the driver and the navigator is that
            one, the navigator, will direct and dictate what code should be written
            to the driver who will type it. Even in cases where the driver isn't
            exactly correct, the driver will type what they say, allowing them to 
            learn from the mistakes.</p>
